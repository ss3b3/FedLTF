# FedLTF: Linear Probing Teaches Fine-tuning to Mitigate Noisy Labels in Federated Learning

This is the official PyTorch code for the following ACML 2024 paper:

**FedLTF: Linear Probing Teaches Fine-tuning to Mitigate Noisy Labels in Federated Learning.**



## Quick Start
`generate_dataset.sh` script provides an example of generating a dataset.

`SSL.sh` script provides an example of the self-supervised training process (Stage 1 in our paper).

`FedLTF.sh` script provides an example of the supervised learning process (Stage 2 and Stage 3 in our paper).


## Thanks

Most of our code is modified on the framework [PFLlib](https://github.com/TsingZ0/PFLlib).
